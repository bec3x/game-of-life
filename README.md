# Conways Game of Life
The Game of Life, created by mathematician John Horton Conway, is a cellular automaton. The game takes place on a two-dimensional grid of square cells. Each cell is in one of two states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

# How to Play the Game of Life
Playing the Game is very easy. Simply go to the url: https://bec3x.github.io/game-of-life/

Once there you may click on cells to create your intial state, or you can use the random button to randomly generate an intial state. Then click run to watch the evolution of the cells. 

You may speed up, slow down, or pause the simulation at any time by using the controls at the top of the screen.
